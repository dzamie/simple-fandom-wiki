# simple-fandom-wiki
Userscript that strips away slow and distracting elements from Fandom Wikis, leaving behind only information. 

The Fandom.com wiki pages are littered with unnecessary, distracting ads, sidebars, hovering menus, comments sections, and more. This can even cause slowdowns while scrolling on some computers. This userscript ensures that ONLY an article's title, content, and category footers are shown, to more plainly and directly convey information. Additionally, it changes the main text color to be black or white, based on contrast with the page's background color.
